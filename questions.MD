### Task questions 

- What types of vehicles should be allowed by the system?
- How single charge rule algorithm should work? In provided code I've used the algorithm provided with
  the source code however, there could be more than one algorithm - for example, the algorithm could select the range
  that will reduce the total tax rate by selecting the most optimal range
- What was expected response format?
- What was the expected request format? I've decided to go with ISO date format, instead of the format provided in a list of dates in the
  task description as it was not precised what was the purpose of those dates
